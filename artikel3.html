            The film by director Benni Setiawan will feature Zee JKT48 and Arbani Yasiz as the main actors. 
            It is known that Zee JKT48 will later play the female character Ancika while Arbani Yasiz plays the figure of Dilan. 
            If previously the character of Dilan was played by Iqbaal Ramadhan, this time the role will be played by Arbani Yasiz. 
            Broadly speaking, the synopsis of Ancika 1995 tells the story of Dilan's love story after breaking up with Milea. 
            From there, Dilan meets a new woman who steals his heart, Ancika.

            Ahead of its screening on January 11, 2024, Zee JKT48 divulged her challenges in playing the female character Ancika. 
            The woman whose full name is Azizi Asadel even had to diet and cut her hair. 
            Mentioned in Pidi Baiq's novel, Ancika has short hair, which is why Zee cut her hair short for her appearance as Ancika. 
            "I cut my hair because Ancika's character herself, according to the novel, has short hair, and my hair (before) was long,
            " Zee said as reported by Kompas.com. 
            As for dieting, Zee felt that she had to do this so that her face did not look round because of her short hair. 
            This 19-year-old woman did her best for her appearance in the 1995 Ancika movie.
